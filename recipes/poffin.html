    <h3>What are Poffins?</h3>
    <p> Poffins are a popular food item in the world of Pokemon that were first
        introduced in the Generation IV games. These delicious treats are popular
        among pokemon contest participants due to having a mystical ability to raise
        certain conditions to help their pokemon glow during beauty contests. In this
        recipe. We will be recreating a Pokemon and Human friendly version of Poffins so
        that Pokemon and Trainers can both enjoy these treats. As a bonus we will be creating
        Poffins with three different fillings.

  <ol>
    <li>Combine milk, yeast, and a pinch of sugar to activate the yeast.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, combine flour and 16 g sugar. Then, add milk yeast mixture.</li>
    <li>After mixing a bit, incorporate salt and continue mixing.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a surface, or use a stand mix, and knead the dough until it looks smooth and even, about 5-6 minutes. Separate into four pieces of dough (for the four variety of filling and colors)</li>
    <li>Flatten the doughs, add butter, a drop of food coloring (respectively to flavors), fold, and continue kneading the doughs until it looks shiny, smooth, and even.</li>
    <p>  - While working on dough, cover the others so they don’t dry</p>
    <li>Place in several greased bowls/baking sheets, cover well with plastic wrap, and allow to rise for 2 hours. It should about double</li>
    <p>  - You want plenty of space between all doughs due to how much it rises and it touching</p>
    <li>Transfer to a flat surface and release the air from the doughs. Begin shaping each dough.</li>
    <li>Depending on the dough yield and preferred size, you can cut each colored dough into 2s</li>

    <p>  - For matcha and potato dough, we will let it rest for 10 minutes so that we can put the filling inside to bake. We want the gluten to relax a little as we will be working with it again.</p>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
    <li>After matcha and potato dough rests, lightly press the air out and begin filling the center with matcha and potato paste, respectively. Pinch dough tightly to close, and shape the bun into poffin.</li>
