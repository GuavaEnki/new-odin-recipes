       to be featured in the Pokemon franchise. When offering Ash and Misty
       some, Brock describes them: "These donuts are great. Jelly filled are
       my favorite." It should be noted that the original food that is featured
       is Onigiri however 4Kids dubbed the food to jelly donut to make it more
       appealing with the western audience.This recipe will show how to make a sweet
       donut variant originally done by Binging with Babish.
