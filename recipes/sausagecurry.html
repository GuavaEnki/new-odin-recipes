  <h3>Spicy Sauasge Curry Origin</h3>
  <p> Pokemon Sword and Shield introduced a cooking mechanic in which trainers
      are able to cook special types of curry from ingredients gathered in the Wild
      Area and by NPCs throughout the game. One of these specialty curries that players
      can create is the Spicy Sausage Curry. This yummy curry is known for having a savory
      yet spicy kick which has been well beloved by pokemon along with their trainers.
